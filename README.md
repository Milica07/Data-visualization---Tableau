# Data-visualization---Tableau
Through this repository I will share my project correlated to data visualization -> Art of data storytelling through visualization   

Data visualization is included in: Share phase of the data analysis process (Ask Prepare Process Analyze Share Act)    

Tableau is specialized data visualization tool, a Business Intelligence and analytics platform (sharing data findings with visualizations)    

Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data 



#### World Happiness 2017
To see the data used for this project feel free to open attached PDF (Table)    

Country was added as a detail of the marks' shelf. This set up viz as a world map to represent the data in the table. Maps: help organize data geographically.   

Next, the happiness score was added to the color on the mark shelf. (Green-Blue Diverging; Stepped color)   

Year was added to the filter shelf (2017).   

Happiness score was added as a label in the map (Happiness score is visible for each country on the map).   

Next, happiness score was added to the filter shelf (selected all values; Happiness Score: 6.0 and below).
